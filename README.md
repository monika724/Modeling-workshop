# README: Three-Phase Strategy for OSD Learning Method in RBF Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a three-phase strategy for the OSD (Optimum Steepest Descent) learning method in Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN). RBFNN is a type of neural network used for tasks like classification and regression. It consists of three layers: Input Layer, Hidden Layer with Radial Basis Function units, and Output Layer.


## Phases of the Learning Method

### Phase 1: Setting the Centers of RBF Units
- **Objective:** Identify the centers of the RBF units.
- **Importance:** Centers act as "focus points" in the data space and help the network learn patterns effectively.
- **Approach:** Select centers that correspond to the data distribution for optimal focus.

### Phase 2: Setting Center Widths
- **Objective:** Calculate and set the widths of the RBF units.
- **Definition:** Widths control the influence area of each center.
- **Approach:** Use the **p-nearest neighbor rule**, which calculates the average distance of the nearest p neighbors to a center.

### Phase 3: Calculating Weights
- **Objective:** Adjust the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer.
- **Method:** Use the **OSD (Optimum Steepest Descent)** algorithm.
- **Initialization:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to initialize weights and speed up convergence.

## Key Concepts
- **RBF Units:** Special units in the hidden layer that transform input data into a higher-dimensional space.
- **p-Nearest Neighbor Rule:** A technique for determining the spread of influence for each center.
- **OSD Algorithm:** An optimization method for adjusting the weights.
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition):** A mathematical technique to initialize the weights.

## Applications
- Pattern recognition
- Regression analysis
- Time series forecasting
